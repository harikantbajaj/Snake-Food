# Snake-Food

This is a modern implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features smooth animations, dynamic grid layout using CSS Grid, and responsive design. Players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes apples randomly placed on the grid. The goal is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with itself or the boundaries of the grid. The game includes features such as score tracking, speed adjustment, and game over detection with sound effects. It serves as both an entertaining game and a learning resource for web development enthusiasts looking to explore modern web technologies and game development techniques.
